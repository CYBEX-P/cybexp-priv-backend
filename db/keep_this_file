This file serves two purpuses:
  - Keeps the folder structure on version control (git)
  - This folder is a place for this module's instance to place its database (critical)
  - These folder is mounted at run time, so it allows for container presistance. One can delete the containiner and recreate it (eg update it), everything will work the same.
